This is a module that allows your to verify and validate an e-mail address.
It's a module that expects to be called from a program, which should send a string containing the e-mail and that should expect to receive a flag value.
If the flag value equals "n", then an error message is sent to the main program; if the flag value equals "s", no message will be displayed.
The main program should be able to receive and display the aproppriate error message.
